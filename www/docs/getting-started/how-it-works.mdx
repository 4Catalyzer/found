# How it works

A reasonably deep dive into how found does what it does.

## An example

Consider the following wireframe of a web app with side navigation
and detail area. The user can navigate to sections (such as "products") and
see a list of products. Clicking further on a product navigates to a nested
detail view with tab navigation for that specific product.

![Product wireframe](../assets/wireframe-l.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Product wireframe](../assets/wireframe-d.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

With Found we can represent this UI with the following route tree and config:

```tsx
import { Route } from "found/jsx";

<Route path="/" Component={AppPage}>
  <Route path="customers">
    <Route Component={CustomersIndexPage} />
    <Route path=":customerId" Component={CustomerPage} />
  </Route>

  <Route path="products">
    <Route Component={ProductsIndexPage} getData={fetchProducts} />
    <Route path="create" Component={ProductCreatePage} />

    <Route
      path=":productId"
      Component={ProductPage}
      getData={fetchProduct}
    >
      <Route
        path="edit"
        Component={ProductEditPage}
        getData={fetchProductById}
      />
      <Route
        path="history"
        Component={ProductHistoryPage}
        getData={fetchProductHistory}
      />
    </Route>
  </Route>

  <Route path="settings" Component={SettingsPage} />
</Route>;
```

Which can also be illustrated via the following tree graph:

![route-tree](../assets/route-graph-l.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![route-tree](../assets/route-graph-d.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

Let's consider a single URL and break down how found determines what UI to show and when.
If we want to navigate to a Product's history page we would use the
following URL: `/products/1/history`. Clicking on a `<Link>`, calling
`router.push('/products/1/history')`, or updating the browser URL bar triggers a new "match" resolution.

## Matching

The first step in routing is to produce a `match`. A match is created by a class called the `Matcher`,
which is generally an implementation detail of Found. Simply put, the Matcher takes a URL and produces a
set of route objects that correspond to that URL.

This is accomplished by decomposing the URL into path segments and "matching" them with nodes in our route tree.
Illustrated here is a match to our Product history page.

![route-match](../assets/route-match-l.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![route-match](../assets/route-match-d.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

If the matcher is able to map the entire URL to a set of Routes, the matching succeeds and a
match object is produced (simplified a bit here):

```js
Match {
  location: {
    pathname: '/products/1/history',
    query: {},
    state: null,
  },
  params: { projectId: '1' },
  routes: [
    { path: '/', Component: AppPage, },
    { path: 'products' },
    { path: ':projectId', Component: ProductPage, getData: fetchProductById },
    { path: 'history', Component: ProductHistoryPage, getData: fetchProductHistory },
  ]
}

```

:::info
matching can only complete at "leaf" nodes in the route tree. This means that
routes that could be leaf or branch nodes (such as `/products`) need to include an
"index" route in order to match sucessfully. An index route is a route with a `Component`
and no `path`, as seen above in the route config.
:::

## Resolution

The next part in the process is "resolving". The router `Resolver` is responsible for mapping the
matched routes to a set of React `element`s in order to render the UI for the URL.
To accomplish this it may need to fetch components or server data asynchronously, as specified by the route.

![resolver](../assets/resolver-l.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![resolver](../assets/resolver-d.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

### Data fetching and code splitting

Each route in the matched set may specify a `getData` property to fetch data necessary to
render its `Component`. The Resolver calls each and collects the returned `Promise`s which are
all allowed to resolve in parallel--unless a route is `deferred`, in which case the promises are split into batches
based on the route hierarchy.

```tsx
const routeData = await Promise.all(
  matchedRoutes.map((route: Route) => {
    return route.getData ? route.getData(match) : undefined;
  });
)
```

Similarly Route components can be asynchronously loaded by specifing `getComponent` instead
of `Component`. Components are also loaded in parallel and awaited before resolving to a set of elements.

```tsx
const routeComponents = await Promise.all(
  matchedRoutes.map((route: Route) => {
    return route.getComponent ? route.getComponent(match) : route.Component;
  });
)
```

### Element construction

After data and components are resolved, each route is constructed into an element that will be rendered
by the Router. Consider how our matched routes relate to the proposed UI:

![route-ui-map](../assets/route-ui-map-l.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![route-ui-map](../assets/route-ui-map-d.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

Each route is ordered by its depth in the route tree and is responsible for
rendering itself as well as any nested routes it may contain. Before we
can compose the UI together we need to construct its individual pieces.
This is done by combining our fetched components and data into elements:

```tsx
const routeComponents = [
  AppPage,
  null,
  ProductPage,
  ProductHistoryPage,
];
const routeData = [null, null, {}, {}];

routes.map((route, index) => {
  const Component = routeComponents[index];
  const data = routeData[index];

  return Component ? <Component data={data} /> : null;
});
```

Finally this array is folded together by the Router into:

```tsx
<AppPage>
  <ProductPage>
    <ProductHistoryPage />
  </ProductPage>
</AppPage>
```

## Loading states

One point that was glossed over is how routes can control their own loading UI
while data and components are being fetched. To handle these states the `Resolver` actually produces multiple
arrays of elements. While waiting for components and data to be fetched it calls each `route.render`,
with the intermediary state. Once the async values are resolved each `route.render` is called again
with the final values.

This gives the route total control over how it handles loading fallbacks for itself and child routes. A Route
can explicitly render nothing (`null`), a loading spinner, a skeleton UI, or whatever else it wants while
it waits for data.

```tsx
routes = [
  // ...
  {
    path: ":productId",
    getComponent: () =>
      import("./components/ProductPage").then((m) => m.default),
    getData: fetchProductById,
    render({ props, Component }) {
      // if Component is not present, it is still being fetched
      if (!Component) {
        return <Spinner />;
      }

      // props is the return value of `getData`
      // If it's not present, data are still loading
      if (!props) {
        <Component showSkeleton />;
      }

      // Otherwise render the component with its props
      return <Component {...props} />;
    },
  },
];
```

:::tip

`null` and `undefined` mean different things as a return value of `router.render`!
If you return `null` the router will render _nothing_ for that element, whereas `undefined`
it treated as a special value that means "I can't render yet", which tells the router to continue
to show the existing UI until the route is ready.

:::

This flexibility allows for easy implementation of many different loading UI patterns!

## Customizing

Nearly all of the behavior covered here is customizable and extensible, making found ideal
for all sorts of of React applications. Checkout our [examples and extensions](/advanced/further-reading.md) for more ideas.
