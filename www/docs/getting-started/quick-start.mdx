# Quick start

Found is a router for [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications with a focus on fetching performance and extensibility.
Found enables "Render-as-You-Fetch" patterns for efficient code splitting and
data fetching in your React applications with or without Suspense. Giving you unmatched control,
and your user's the best experiences.

Found is designed to be extremely customizable. Almost all behavior and pieces can be changed or fully replaced.
Including the path matching algorithm and route UI construction.
This allows [extensions](/advanced/further-reading.md) such as [Found Relay](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found-relay) to
provide first-class support for different use cases.

## Installation and setup

Include the packages in your product via your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm i found

# or yarn
yarn add found
```

`found` depends on the relatively new async iterators proposal, which may require a **polyfill** of
`Symbol.asyncIterator` for older browsers. Core-js provides one if needed, import **before**
importing found. Check against your supported browser matrix to see if this is necessary.

```js
import "core-js/es/symbol/async-iterator";
```

## Basic usage

Found provides rich client-side route, for your Single Page Application. It allows you to define
your web application in terms of the URL just like traditional multi-page browser navigation, while
also efficiently updating the your page as the URL changes, only loading and changing the parts of your application
that need to. This enables unmatched data fetching efficiency and code code splitting, while providing users with a
fast, ultra-responsive browsering experience.

To get started, define the "routes", or urls your application supports and the UI they require.

<SandpackEditor>

```tsx
import { createBrowserRouter, Link } from "found";

const routeConfig = [
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: () => (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <Link to="/about">About Us</Link>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    Component: () => (
      <div>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to found</p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
];

const BrowserRouter = createBrowserRouter({ routeConfig });

export default function App() {
  return <BrowserRouter />;
}
```

</SandpackEditor>

Routes, can also be specified as JSX if you prefer, using `Route`, and `makeRouteConfig`:

```tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createBrowserRouter, Route } from "found";

const BrowserRouter = createBrowserRouter({
  routeConfig: makeRouteConfig(
    <>
      <Route path="/" Component={HomePage} />
      <Route path="/about" Component={AboutPage} />
    </>
  ),
});
```

## Nested routes

Best described by found's original inspiration `react-router` (who also borrowed the idea from Ember):

> Nested Routing is the general idea of coupling segments of the URL to component hierarchy and data.

Nested routing is similar to "layouts" in server-side templating languages, allowings reuse of components, as well as
connecting components with their data requirements.

<SandpackEditor startRoute='/dashboard'>

```tsx
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  makeRouteConfig,
  Route,
  Link,
} from "found";

function AppPage({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>{" "}
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
}

const Router = createBrowserRouter({
  routeConfig: makeRouteConfig(
    <Route path="/" Component={AppPage}>
      <Route
        path="dashboard"
        Component={() => <h1>Dashboard page</h1>}
      />
      <Route path="about" Component={() => <h1>About page</h1>} />
    </Route>
  ),
});

export default function App() {
  return <Router />;
}
```

</SandpackEditor>

Here the route passes `children` to `AppPage` which will be the resolved nested routes component
for the current location. In otherwords, when on `/about` the "About page" header will render and on
`/dashboard` "Dashboard page". Because both routes start with `/` they are children of `AppPage`.

:::tip

You can use [spa-routing](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/spa-routing) to manage your links in an organized and well-typed way

:::

### Index routes

A URL will 404 if there is no exact match for it in the route config.

```tsx
<Route path="/">
  <Route path="customers" Component={CustomersPage}>
    <Route path=":customerId" Component={CustomerPage} />
  </Route>
</Route>
```

For the above config only `/customers/1/` will render, while `'/customers'` will `404`. However if want
to render a customers list page, we can add an "index route", which is a route with no `path`.

```tsx
<Route path="/">
  <Route path="customers">
    <Route Component={CustomersPage} />
    <Route path=":customerId" Component={CustomerPage} />
  </Route>
</Route>
```

If you need a parent route to function as a parent while also rendering
as the index route when there is no customer mark the parent route with `allowAsIndex`.

```tsx
<Route path="/">
  <Route path="customers" allowAsIndex Component={CustomersPage}>
    <Route path=":customerId" Component={CustomerPage} />
  </Route>
</Route>
```

## Dynamic route parameters

Routes, can also be parameterized, allowing you to represent state through URLs. Route components
are passed `match` as a prop which contains `params` (amoung other things). Any component can access
the current route props using `useParams` as well.

<SandpackEditor startRoute='customers/1/orders/1'>

```tsx
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  makeRouteConfig,
  Route,
  Link,
} from "found";
import useParams from "found/useParams";

function CustomerPage({ children, match }) {
  const { customerId } = match.params;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Customer #{customerId}</h1>

      <h2>Orders</h2>
      <nav>
        <Link to={`/customers/${customerId}/orders/1`}>Order 1</Link>{" "}
        <Link to={`/customers/${customerId}/orders/2`}>Order 2</Link>
      </nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
}

function OrderPage() {
  const { orderId } = useParams();

  return <div>Order #{orderId}</div>;
}

const Router = createBrowserRouter({
  routeConfig: makeRouteConfig(
    <Route path="customers/:customerId" Component={CustomerPage}>
      <Route path="orders/:orderId" Component={OrderPage} />
    </Route>
  ),
});

export default function App() {
  return <Router />;
}
```

</SandpackEditor>

:::tip

All params are accessible to every component and routes not just the `Route` that
declares it.

:::

Route params are flexible and allow "splats" as well as regular expressions, see [path](/docs/configuration/route-config#path)
for all the details.

## Loading data

Found has out-of-the-box support for efficient data fetching. Add a `getData` function to any route and it's return value
will be passed to the Route as a `data` prop. see [Data fetching](data-fetching) for more details about how found
avoids waterfalls and overfetching.

<SandpackEditor>

```tsx
import "./styles.css";

import { createBrowserRouter, HttpError } from "found";
import PostsPage from "./PostsPage";
import PostPage from "./PostPage";

async function fetchFromApi(path: string) {
  const resp = await fetch(`https://dummyjson.com${path}`);

  if (!resp.ok) throw new HttpError(404);
  return resp.json();
}

const Router = createBrowserRouter({
  routeConfig: [
    {
      path: "/",
      getData: () => fetchFromApi("/posts"),
      Component: PostsPage,
    },
    {
      path: "posts/:postId",
      getData: async ({ params }) =>
        fetchFromApi(`/posts/${params.postId}/`),
      Component: PostPage,
    },
  ],
});

export default function App() {
  return <Router />;
}
```

```tsx PostsPage.tsx
import { Link, RouteComponentDataProps } from "found";
import type { Post } from "./PostPage.tsx";

export default function PostsPage({
  data,
  children,
}: RouteComponentDataProps<{ posts: Post[] }>) {
  return (
    <div className="posts">
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      {data?.posts.map((post) => (
        <Link key={post.id} to={`/posts/${post.id}`}>
          {post.title}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx PostPage.tsx
import type { RouteComponentDataProps } from "found";

export interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  body: string;
}

export default function PostPage({
  data: post,
  children,
}: RouteComponentDataProps<Post>) {
  return (
    <main>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <p>{post.body}</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

```css styles.css
.posts {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}

.posts > a {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 200px;
  text-align: center;
}
```
