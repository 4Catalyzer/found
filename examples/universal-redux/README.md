# Found Universal Redux Example

This example uses the same route configuration as the [basic JSX example](../basic-jsx), but uses server-side rendering for the initial page load and a custom Redux store. The server initially populates and dehydrates the Redux store, then the client rehydrates the server's state.

## Usage

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
