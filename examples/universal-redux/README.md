# Found Universal Redux Example

This example uses the same route configuration as the [basic JSX
example](../basic-jsx), but uses server-side rendering for the initial page
load and a custom redux store. The redux store is initially populated on the
server and then the client rehydrates itself with the server's state.

## Usage

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
